                A functional experience is covered by UX and the necessary and
                interactive visualization is covered by UI hence they work
                closely on interdependence. It’s about one egg in many baskets
                considering the access given to consumer on multiple devices
                hence the catering towards demands becomes more fluidic and
                elastic in consideration of platform. The research team at
                CodeLover Technology discusses and gains a holistic perspective
                of the client, the business and target consumers to create a
                product that is easy to navigate, and boosts the interaction and
                experience over several iterations prior to the completion of
                the design. It is this that makes CodeLover Technology one of
                the few digital agencies that can flawlessly take a product from

                Wire framing helps us in improvising and making it a better
                website. We take inputs from the research team and stake
                holders’ feedback to work on the areas of functional
                improvement. Drafting the skeleton gives us a perspective of
                final content result and helps us in adjusting and modifying the
                wireframe. Our designer focuses on the placement of content with
                the help of excellent wire framing tools to illustrate the flow
                of your website. Our sketching team uses top of the line tools

                Colors have a great influence on human moods and certain colours
                have a specific association in our minds (it’s a pre
                conditioning for e.g. Red is Danger or Love) and hence colors
                cause a certain reaction in your consumers. UI creates a
                contrast that serves the right amount of harmony between
                different colors. Synchronization of color brings a perspective
                and a Call to Action. CodeLover Technology pays good attention
                to texts, fonts, animation and layouts to create the right set
                of combination between color groups and designs, ensuring an
                interface that connects and leaves a relevant psychological
                effect to create a better experience that also influences your
                consumer.
