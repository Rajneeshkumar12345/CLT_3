                  In todayâ€™s world of collaboration and integrated environment,
                  the presence of .Net Technology is one of the features
                  intended to connect with the rest of the world. Through the
                  flexibility of interacting interfaces like Desktops, Phones,
                  TVs, Browsers, Internet etc, .NET is a platform to allow a
                  developer for making intelligent applications with
                  interoperability across platforms and that too in a limited
                  timeframe. .Net is a top notch domain which was earlier
                  designed for Internet Service Providers (ISP), but now has
                  been extended; so that everybody can create use of a .net
                  domain. It uses the Internet Domain Naming System (DNS) and it
                  is a contraction of the word 'Network'. The main part of the
                  .Net technology & structure is the ASP.net set of
                  technologies. These web development technologies are used in
                  the making of Websites and net services working on the .NET
                  infrastructure. ASP.NET was built by Microsoft from one of
                  their big technologies; and web programmers can make use of
                  any encoding language they want to write from Perl to C Sharp
                  (C#) and of course VB.NET. The advantages of the ASP.NET
                  technology are that it creates websites, web applications and
                  web services in a simple way with the application of fewer
                  codes. As well, the applications compiled in ASP.NET run
                  quicker and with fewer errors. The advantages of the ASP.NET
                  technology are that it creates websites, web applications and
                  web services in a simple way with the application of fewer
                  codes. As well, the applications compiled in ASP.NET run
                  quicker and with fewer errors. (1) Dot Net is assimilated with
                  a large library that gives higher scope for developers (2) It
                  is made compatible with other programming languages (3) Large
                  database of library offers tools for user interface, data
                  access, data connectivity and network communications (4) Our
                  developers assist the client with Dot Net features of Common
                  Language Runtime Engine (CLR). All programs executed under the
                  CLR guarantees certain behavioral properties in the areas of
                  memory management and security. (5) This is the only
                  programming tool that features Interoperability, Language
                  Independence, Base Class Library and Common Language Runtime
                  Engine under one single roof.
