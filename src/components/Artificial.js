                ways, thanks to machine intelligent systems. We are living in a
                cognitive era where systems can see, listen, respond, and learn
                from every interaction we make, and redefine the existing

                Learning (ML) in business is increasing due to the value proven
                on its applications in different areas of the business. AI and
                ML will be playing major roles and will be increasingly used to
                personalize products and services. You can unlock endless
                possibilities with the help of data-driven personalization and
                immersive experience. Today, many organizations bank on AI and
                ML in order to effectively utilize data to understand and
                predict patterns in customer behavior and market trends. Machine
                Learning and Artificial Intelligence has transcended business
                operations and made it possible for businesses to operate
                flawlessly without any human intervention.

                In a simple term website testing is a process to examine your
                website for potential errors and areas of improvement. As a part
                of SEO, testing helps in improving the performance and the
                functionality along with the UI. Testing process includes
                multiple stages from checking the functionality, usability,
                compatibly and interface. Coding helps in defining the structure
                and planning the layout of your webpage.
