                With over 2.5 billion active users as of May 2019, the reach
                provided by Android apps is huge. Businesses today are getting
                into mobile app development with the intention of higher
                business revenue. CodeLover Technology provides Android App Development
                services to its clients to go digital and mobile. Our solutions
                are custom made and are tailored as per your project needs so
                that the application we develop for you delivers real business
                value. An App that provides instant access to your online
                presence and offerings must have a predefined goal that it aims
                to achieve for the business. Our developers understand the
                psychology and potential of apps, and we realise that while
                convenience is important, we also aid our clients to define the
                purpose of the app and then we tailor our internal process in
                order to achieve it.

                customers and map it against the goal of your app, what players
                offering similar solutions as the client’s business are already
                providing – basically its entails scoping the market to decide
                the mobile app to be developed. It helps us draw the required
                engineering map for the app. Keeping your budget in mind, we
                develop estimates and resources to prototype the app. The reason
                is a deeply researched and well-designed roadmap.

                After the basic idea is ready, our team creates visually
                appealing and utility-driven samples for you to choose. This
                stage puts the app into shape, based on the direction and
                clarity gained on the project framework during the Discovery
                stage. We pay close attention to the design of your future
                product. It is here that all the functional specifications and
                aspects relating to the app’s features, user flows, UI & tech
                implications are weighed and the technology which is most
                appropriate to you is finalised. Our UX team determines the best
                ways to enhance the app via animations, graphics, gestures and
                simplification.

                Once through with the wireframing, our team sketches up the
                prototype to a feature-rich Android solution. Our UX/UI team
                will design the architectural plan, based on your business
                needs. Our developers carry out frontend, backend, site build,
                mobile developer tasks under the coordination of our project
                managers. We solicit inputs from our clients in this
                collaborative process to make changes, if necessary. With
                advanced algorithms and expert technical capabilities, the
                CodeLover Technology team develops a mock-up of the app for you basis your
                brief. This is a very important step and we work hard to give
                you the best customer experience to meet your business needs. It
                is here that the things on the development front are aligned
                with the designs so that there are no surprises in the end and
                that both parties are on the same page.

                At CodeLover Technology , our comprehensive review exercise is based on
                following the desired outcome of the project to be delivered –
                in most cases our clients are looking at SEO friendly, modern,
                user friendly &amp; dynamic websites. Our performance reviews
                are decisive to find out the deficits or challenges faced, if
                any during the development process, which helps us to raise the
                bar over time. The review is a comprehensive report of feedback
                from you as a partner and as well as your business inputs. The
                review reports define and form the basis of our course of action
                for the future.
