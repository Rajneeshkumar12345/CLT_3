                In a simple term website testing is a process to examine your
                website for potential errors and areas of improvement. As a part
                of SEO, testing helps in improving the performance and the
                functionality along with the UI. Testing process includes
                multiple stages from checking the functionality, usability,
                compatibly and interface. Coding helps in defining the structure
                and planning the layout of your webpage.

                            Working with CLT technologies was a pleasant
                            experience. Things that stand out in particular
                            about them are – Their services, their quick
                            response to queries, they were always available to
                            provide feedback as the project went along.
                            Secondly, they demonstrated a clear understanding of
                            the scope and nature of the project and delivered
                            accordingly.
